          "conclusion": "<b>Observer Name</b> <b>History of present Illness</b> <p>This 19-year-old black female, nulligravida, was admitted to the hospital on June 14, 1999 with fever of 102°, left lower quadrant pain, vaginal discharge, constipation, and a tender left adnexal mass. Her past history and family history were unremarkable. Present pain had started 2 to 3 weeks prior (starting on May 30, 1999) and lasted for 6 days. She had taken contraceptive pills in the past, but had stopped because she was not sexually active.</p><b>Physical Examination</b> <p>She appeared well-developed and well-nourished, and in mild distress. The only positive physical findings were limited to the abdomen and pelvis. Her abdomen was mildly distended, and it was tender, especially in the lower left quadrant. At pelvic examination her cervix was tender on motion, and the uterus was of normal size, retroverted, and somewhat fixed. There was a tender cystic mass about 4 - 5 cm in the left adnexa. Rectal examination was negative.</p><b>Admitting Diagnosis</b> <p>1. Probable pelvic inflammatory disease (PID).\n2. Rule out ectopic pregnancy.</p><b>Laboratory Data on Admission</b> <p>Hb 8.8, Hct 26.5, WBC 8,100 with 80 segs and 18 lymphs. Sedimentation rate 100 mm in one hour. Sickle cell prep + (turned out to be a trait). Urinalysis normal. Electrolytes normal. SMA-12 normal. Chest x-ray negative, 2 hour UCG negative.</p><b>Hospital Course and Treatment</b> <p>Initially, she was given cephalothin 2 gm IV q6h, and kanamycin 0.5 gm IM b.i.d. Over the next 2 days the patient's condition improved. Her pain decreased, and her temperature came down to normal int he morning and spiked to 101° in the evening. Repeat CBC showed Hb 7.8, Hct 23.5. The pregnancy test was negative. On the second night following the admission, her temperature spiked to 104º. The patient was started on antituberculosis treatment, consisting of isoniazid 300 mg/day, ethambutol 600 mg b.i.d., and rifampin 600 mg daily. She became afebrile on the sixth postoperative day and was discharged on July 15, 1999, in good condition. She will be seen in the office in one week.</p><b>Surgical Procedures</b> <p>Biopsy of omentum for frozen section; culture specimens.</p><b>Discharge Diagnosis</b> <p>Genital tuberculosis.</p>"
